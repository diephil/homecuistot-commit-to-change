## Gemini Builds Reference

The `gemini-builds/` folder contains mockups created directly with AI Studio feature. These serve as reference for what we're building.

**Important:** Code in this folder should NOT be used as-is. It must be revised and properly integrated into our codebase, following our coding practices, architecture, and standards.

- Stop Opik only: `make opdown`

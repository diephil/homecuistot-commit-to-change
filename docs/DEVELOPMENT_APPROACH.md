# Development Approach

Our philosophy for building maintainable AI agents in 3 weeks.

**[← Back to README](../README.md)**

## Core Philosophy

**We didn't try to build the perfect and most complex AI agent in 3 weeks.** Instead, we focused on steady, small iterations toward building agents that can be improved over time through data-driven measurements using Opik.

The goal wasn't to architect the perfect system upfront, but to iterate steadily with data-driven improvements. Start simple, measure with Opik, identify gaps, refine. Complex patterns—multi-agent delegation, elaborate guardrails, callback orchestration—are added only when measurements prove they're needed, not upfront. This approach keeps the system maintainable by limiting the improvement surface area at any stage.

**Build → Measure → Learn**

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Start Simple, Add Complexity Only When Data Proves It's Needed

We didn't build elaborate subagent delegation, complex guardrails, or multi-layer orchestration from day one. We built simple agents first, measured their performance with Opik, and added complexity only where measurements showed it was necessary.

**Example**: Started with Gemini `generateObject()` calls → Measured precision/recall gaps → Evolved to ADK agents with tools when data showed function-calling improved accuracy.

---

### 2. Keep the Surface Area of Improvements Manageable

It's better to have a simple, maintainable agent you can improve than a complex one you can't debug. Each agent has a clear responsibility and evaluation criteria.

**Agent Boundaries**:
- **Ingredient Extractor**: Add/remove operations only
- **Recipe Manager**: CRUD operations with ingredient validation
- **Inventory Manager**: Quantity updates and pantry management

---

### 3. Let Measurements Guide Architecture

Opik traces inform every decision: which agents need tools, where agents fall short, what prompts need refinement. We're not guessing—we're measuring.

**Data-Driven Examples**:
- Opik traces showed "greek yogurt" unrecognized → promoted to ingredient DB
- Span metadata showed users mixing languages → added auto-translation to ingredient extractor

---

## What We Did Right

### ✅ Iterative Development
Simple Gemini calls → ADK agents with tools → evaluation pipelines

### ✅ Data-Driven Decisions
Opik traces inform agent improvements and database enrichment

### ✅ Manageable Scope
Each agent has clear responsibility and evaluation criteria (ingredient recognition scores, recipe operations scores, etc.)

### ✅ Production-Ready Observability
Full tracing, custom evaluation task metrics, prompt versioning from day one

### ✅ Feedback Loop
Metadata and tags attached to Opik spans allow inspecting spans using Opik REST APIs and building a feedback loop mechanism that improves our system based on Opik production traces

---

## Where We're Still Iterating (Honest Limitations)

We're not presenting a perfect system. Here's what we're actively improving:

### 1. Dataset Refinement Needed

**Current**: Mixed creation/update/deletion operations in a single recipe-manager dataset

**Future**: Split into separate datasets (creation-only, update-only, deletion-only) for precise evaluation

**Reason**: Mixed scenarios add friction to performance analysis—we can't isolate which operation type is underperforming

---

### 2. Audio Processing Pipeline Validation

**Current**: Manual testing only for voice input flows

**Planning**: Opik audio datasets to test "voice-transcriptor → inventory-manager" and "voice-transcriptor → recipe-manager" sequential architectures

**Why**: Need automated evaluation of end-to-end voice flows, not just text-based agent testing

---

### 3. Custom Metric Performance

**Status**: Still tuning F1 thresholds and metric definitions

**Learning**: What "good enough" means for each agent type (precision vs recall trade-offs)

**Iterating**: Recipe ingredient extraction needs >95% F1, but inventory updates can tolerate lower precision if recall is high

---

## What We Learned About Opik Integration

### The Good ✅

- **Custom tracing worked smoothly** for ADK agents (no native OTel support)
- **opik-gemini automatic tracing** saved significant development time
- **Prompt versioning + dataset framework** enabled rapid iteration
- **Direct API integration** for span querying and tag management gave us full control

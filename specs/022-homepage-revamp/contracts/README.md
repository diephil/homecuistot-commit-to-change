# API Contracts

**Feature**: 022-homepage-revamp

---

## Overview

**Not applicable** - No API contracts required for this feature.

This is a static content change with no backend integration, API endpoints, or data contracts.

---

## Rationale

The homepage messaging revamp involves only client-side JSX/TSX content updates in the Next.js page component. There are:

- No new API endpoints created
- No existing API endpoints modified
- No GraphQL schema changes
- No WebSocket connections
- No third-party API integrations

The page remains statically rendered with no server-side data fetching beyond Next.js's standard page props (if any, which are not modified in this feature).
